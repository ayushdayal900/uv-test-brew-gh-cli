## 📦 What is a Package Manager?

A **package manager** automates software management:

| Task                | Manual Approach                          | Package Manager Approach            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Install software    | Download → Extract → Configure → Install | `brew install <package>`            |
| Update software     | Track versions manually                  | `brew upgrade`                      |
| Manage dependencies | Install each dependency manually         | Automatically resolves dependencies |
| Uninstall software  | Delete files manually                    | `brew uninstall <package>`          |

## ⚡ Installing Software with Homebrew

Installing software is simple:

```bash
brew install <package>
```

Example:

```bash
brew install git
```

> Homebrew will automatically download the correct version and all required dependencies.

---

## ⬆ Updating Software

Update all installed packages with a single command:

```bash
brew upgrade
```

To update Homebrew itself:

```bash
brew update
```

This keeps Homebrew’s **core and formulae** up-to-date.

---

## ❓ What is a Dependency?

A **dependency** is software or a library required for another program to work.

Homebrew automatically handles dependencies:

```text
Installing Node.js also installs npm as a dependency.
```
